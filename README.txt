Hello guys~

The repository consists of 3 main folders:
1. Backend_Code
2. Frontend_Code
3. CARES

Each folder is created for experimenting on specific features and implementations found in the first and second folder above, while the
third folder contains the inventory system itself. I implemented this in case we want to test out new features but are unsure if we will
include it as part of the system.

Moreover, its made to keep our files categorized and organized.
