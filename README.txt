Hello guys~

The repository consists of 3 main folders:
1. Backend_Code
2. Frontend_Code
3. CARES

Each folder is created to experiment with specific features and implementations found in the first and second folders above, while the third folder contains the inventory system itself. I implemented this in case we want to test new features, but are unsure if we will include it as part of the system. Moreover, it's made to keep our files categorized and organized.
